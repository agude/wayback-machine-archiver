# Wayback Machine Archiver

Wayback Machine Archiver (Archiver for short) is a commandline utility writen
in Python to backup Github Pages using the [Internet Archive][ia].

[ia]: https://archive.org/

## Installation

The best way to install Archiver is with `pip`:

```bash
pip install wayback-machine-archiver
```

This will give you access to the script simply by calling:

```bash
archiver --help
```

You can also clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agude/wayback-machine-archiver.git
cd wayback-machine-archiver
python ./wayback_machine_archiver/archiver.py --help
```

If you clone the repository, Archiver can be installed as a local application
using the `setup.py` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agude/wayback-machine-archiver.git
cd wayback-machine-archiver
./setup.py install
```

Which, like using `pip`, will give you access to the script by calling
`archiver`.

Archiver requires [the `requests` library][requests] by Kenneth Reitz.
Archiver supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4+.

## Usage

The simplest way to schedule a backup is by specifying the URL of a web page,
like so:

```bash
archiver https://alexgude.com
```

This will submit the main page of my blog, [alexgude.com][ag], to the Wayback
Machine for archiving.

[ag]: https://alexgude.com

You can also archive all the URLs specified in a [`sitemap.xml`][sitemap] as
follows:

[sitemap]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps

```bash
archiver --sitemaps https://alexgude.com/sitemap.xml
```

This will backup every page listed in the sitemap of my website, [alexgude.com][ag].

You can also pass a sitemap.xml file (requires the `file://` prefix) to the archiver:

```bash
archiver --sitemaps file://sitemap.xml
```

You can backup multiple pages by specifying multiple URLs or sitemaps:

```bash
archiver https://radiokeysmusic.com --sitemaps https://charles.uno/sitemap.xml https://alexgude.com/sitemaps.xml
```

You can also backup multiple URLs by writing them to a file (for example,
`urls.txt`), one URL per line, and passing that file to archiver:

```bash
archiver --file urls.txt
```

Sitemaps often exclude themselves, so you can request that the sitemap itself
be backed up using the flag `--archive-sitemap-also`:

```bash
archiver --sitemaps https://alexgude.com/sitemaps.xml --archive-sitemap-also
```

## Setting Up a `Sitemap.xml` for Github Pages
